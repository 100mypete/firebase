    <div class="container"><h1 class="text-glow">He details a few points on porn addiction, and tells us that hentai is in the same boat. Stating that porn addiction, as a behavioral addiction, trains your brain to feel stimulated by porn while reducing your sex drive outside of the time you watch it. Depending on how bad you think porn addiction is, you’ll probably reflect on this point differently. Even though I don’t feel porn addiction is as bad as this guy says, I think it’s also a valid point. It obviously isn’t unique just to hentai, but I don’t think it needs to be (in a similar manner to his first point).

      When people watch animation, we have to remember that Suspension of Disbelief is greatly in effect.
